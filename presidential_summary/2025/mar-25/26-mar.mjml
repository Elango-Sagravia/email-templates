          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5">Iwao Hakamata, an 89-year-old Japanese man who spent over 45 years on death row, was awarded $1.4 Mn in compensation after his acquittal last year. Hakamata was wrongfully convicted of a <a style="text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 2px solid  #4D3060; color: black;" href="https://link.presidentialsummary.com/ps-26-03-2025-h1-1-1966-quadruple-murder" target="_blank">1966 quadruple murder</a>. He was sentenced to death in 1968 based on fabricated police evidence. DNA testing later revealed the bloodstained clothing was planted long after the crime.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5">Hakamata’s case is the longest death row incarceration worldwide. It sparked international criticism of Japan’s justice system and 99% conviction rate. Hakamata was released in 2014 pending retrial and finally acquitted in 2023. His lawyer called the payout the highest ever for wrongful conviction in Japan, but said it could never undo the damage. “I think the state (government) has made a mistake that cannot be atoned for with $1.4 Mn,” his lawyer Hideyo Ogawa said, according to NHK.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5">Hakamata was a professional boxer who retired in 1961 and got a job at a soybean processing plant in Shizuoka, central Japan. After five years, he was arrested after the members of his boss’s household were found dead. Hakamata’s decades behind bars severely damaged his mental health. His sister says he lives in his own world and cannot grasp reality or the details of his case.</p>

Masked and armed settlers stormed the village of Susiya during Ramadan, attacking Ballal outside his home. Witnesses say soldiers pointed guns at Palestinians while settlers threw stones.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5">Ballal was injured and bloodied and later detained on accusations of throwing stones. Ballal co-directed “No Other Land,” a documentary about Palestinian struggles under Israeli occupation. The documentary won Best Documentary at the 2025 Oscars. His wife believes the attack was retaliation for the film’s success. Rights groups report a spike in settler violence and Israeli military raids across the West Bank amid the Gaza war.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5">Ballal’s case has drawn international attention to ongoing violence and the treatment of Palestinians. Meanwhile, more anger ensues as Al Jazeera reporter Hossam Shabat was killed in a strike in Gaza. He started reporting on the war when it first broke out, just before he was supposed to finish university; he was 23.</p>

          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5">Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, called for the resignation of senior Trump administration officials after the big <a style="text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 2px solid  #4D3060; color: black;" href="https://link.presidentialsummary.com/ps-26-03-2025-h3-3-scandal-involving-a-signal-chat" target="_blank">scandal involving a Signal chat</a>. The scandal involved planning a military strike in Yemen, which was made public by The Atlantic's Editor, Goldberg's accidental inclusion in the chat. Warner posted on X during the hearing that “incompetence is not an option.”</p>
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5">The democrat accused Pete Hegseth and Mike Waltz of failing to conduct “security hygiene 101.” He called their actions "sloppy" and "careless" since classified information should never be shared over unclassified systems. Other Democrats are calling for their resignation or removal. Warner also grilled intelligence director Tulsi Gabbard over the group. Gabbard did not admit to being part of this chat.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5">Despite this, CIA Director John Ratcliffe downplayed the incident, calling it an "inadvertent mistake." Warner also pointed out the risks posed by third-party messaging apps like Signal. China and Russia are reportedly trying to infiltrate. While it seemed like Trump was mulling over the idea of firing Waltz, he is off the hook for now. The White House defended the officials, with Trump calling Waltz a "good man" who had learned a lesson.</p>
