          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">Relations between Ukraine and Hungary are becoming more tense. Hungary has increasingly become Moscow-friendly and has expanded Russian gas imports via Turkey, defying EU efforts to reduce its reliance on Russian energy. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto accused Ukraine of worsening Europe’s energy crisis by ending the gas transit deal with Russia. Ukraine dismissed the claims, stating that the alleged negative impact of the crisis is part of a <a href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-10-01-2025-h1-1-politcally-motivated-information-campaign" target="_blank">politically motivated information campaign</a> and added that the EU’s energy security is not threatened. They also mockingly offered to replace Hungary in the EU and NATO if Budapest aligned with Russian-led blocs like the CIS or CSTO.</p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">Kyiv criticized Hungary’s stance as undermining EU unity and asked to focus on its energy security and independence. They also added that Slovakia and Austria were trying to pass on the blame instead of working on their energy problems, which were the 2 of the 27 countries affected by the gas transit deal cancellation. Ukraine also praised the European Commission and governments for the successful <a href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-10-01-2025-h1-2-diversification-of-supply" target="_blank">diversification of supply</a> with alternatives from the US and the Middle East.</p>

In addition, both presided over the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which drastically affected both countries.</p>

          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">Israeli forces have retrieved the body of Bedouin Arab hostage Youssef al-Zayadna in a "complex and difficult operation" in Gaza. His body was recovered from an underground tunnel in Rafah and returned to Israel for identification. Al-Zayadna and his son Hamza were taken hostage during the <a href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-10-01-2025-h3-5-october-2023-hamas-attack" target="_blank">October 2023 Hamas attack</a> on Kibbutz Holit.

          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">There are around 300,000 Bedouin Arabs in Israel. They make up a subset of the 2 million Arabs in Israel. They have been doubly victimized by settling them in proximity to Hamas rockets and by state marginalization that has worsened since the October 2023 attack. Mediators Qatar, Egypt, and the U.S. are brokering a ceasefire and hostage deal. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated that a <a href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-10-01-2025-h3-6-ceasefire-and-hostage-agreement" target="_blank">ceasefire and hostage agreement</a> is "very close."

          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, began his annual New Year tour of Africa on Sunday. This is a 35-year tradition that underscores Beijing's steady engagement with the continent. Analysts claim that while Western powers are preoccupied with wars, domestic politics, and leadership transitions, <a href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-10-01-2025-br1-7-china-engagement-with-africa" target="_blank">China’s engagement with Africa</a> showcases consistency. Wang's visits to Namibia, the Republic of Congo, Chad, and Nigeria this week highlight China's focus on resource access, infrastructure development, and strengthening trade ties with the continent. Africa's 50-plus UN votes also position it as a key ally in China's push to reshape multilateral institutions and global norms.</p>

World leaders, including Emmanuel Macron and Joe Biden, extended their warm congratulations by calling Aoun “the right leader for this time.”</p>

           <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">The African Union (AU) was launched in 2002, replacing the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), established in 1963 to promote unity and independence across Africa. The <a href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-10-01-2025-f1-9-african-union-mission" target="_blank">African Union's mission</a> centers on fostering greater integration, socio-economic development, and peace throughout the continent. Its goals are to promote democracy, human rights, sustainable development, and collaboration with international partners.
</p>
           <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">The AU's structure includes key decision-making bodies, such as the Assembly of Heads of State, the Executive Council, and other specialized committees. Additionally, the AU focuses on regional integration through Economic Communities and aims for long-term transformation through its <a href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-10-01-2025-f2-10-agenda-2063-framework" target="_blank">Agenda 2063 framework</a>.
</p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">The AU is made up of 55 Member States, representing all the countries on the African continent. It is divided into five geographic regions. Morocco was out of the Union for an extended period but rejoined in 2017. There are six members currently on suspension: Gabon, Niger, Guinea, Sudan, Burkina Faso, and Mali.</p>
