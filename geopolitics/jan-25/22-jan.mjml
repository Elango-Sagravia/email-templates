          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">Donald Trump has ordered the US withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement and the World Health Organization (WHO). Trump justified these moves as protecting American interests, reigniting debates about the country’s role in global cooperation. The WHO, the largest global health body, <a href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-22-01-2025-h1-1-expressed-regret" target="_blank">expressed regret</a>, emphasizing that the US contributed 18% of its funding. Germany and other nations vowed to lobby Trump to reconsider. The US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement undermines global climate efforts and has drawn criticism from environmental advocates.</p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">Trump has been vocal in his disapproval of multilateralism, and his exits were expected once he won the elections. However, the timing of his exit raises questions as the US is in the middle of the California fire, during which people have lost their livelihoods. Climate change is also becoming evident with hurricanes, heavy rainfall, heat waves, and sea level acceleration. Laurence Tubiana commented on <a href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-22-01-2025-h1-2-the-us-exit" target="_blank">the US exit</a>, stating that “international climate action has proven resilient and is stronger than any single country's politics and policies.”</p>

          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">Lebanon’s President Joseph Aoun has called for Israel to withdraw from southern Lebanon by the January 26 deadline, as stipulated in the November 27 ceasefire agreement. Speaking with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Aoun criticized Israel’s ongoing violations, including border village destruction and airspace incursions, as contradicting the accord.</p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">The agreement requires Israel to withdraw as the Lebanese army and UNIFIL peacekeepers deploy in the south. Meanwhile, Hezbollah must relocate its forces north of the Litani River and dismantle its southern military infrastructure. Hezbollah leader Naim Qassem warned Israel against testing their patience. In addition to Israel, the new Lebanese government has the Hezbollah situation to reckon with. While Hezbollah remains influential, its recent losses in the war with Israel, <a href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-22-01-2025-h2-3-strained-alliance" target="_blank">strained alliances</a>, and diminished access to weapons have weakened its position.</p>

          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">French President Emmanuel Macron has stressed the need for Europe to strengthen its militaries in response to Trump’s new term as president. He emphasized Europe’s need to <a href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-22-01-2025-h3-4-reduce-reliance" target="_blank">reduce reliance</a> on the US for security, framing Trump’s approach as a “strategic wake-up call” for the continent. Macron questions  Europe’s preparedness for a US withdrawal from the Mediterranean or a shift in military focus to the Pacific. The situation of how much Trump is willing to support Ukraine is also a subject of concern.</p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">
          The European Union has depended mainly on the US for its defense. Discussions about building its defense came about during Trump’s first term, and while it wasn’t completely realized, many NATO member countries have gone on to meet the <a href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-22-01-2025-h3-5-2-defense-budget" target="_blank">2% defense budget</a>.  All but three EU members are part of NATO. Macron urges robust European support for Ukraine and the importance of post-war security guarantees. European leaders are expected to discuss joint defense initiatives and increased military funding in the coming months.

          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">Yemen's Houthis announced they will limit attacks on commercial vessels to those linked to Israel, provided the Gaza ceasefire is fully implemented. This move may <a href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-22-01-2025-br1-6-ease-disruptions" target="_blank">ease disruptions</a> in global trade caused by year-long Houthi attacks in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. The group stated it would halt operations against US and British-flagged ships unless Yemen is attacked but will continue targeting Israeli-linked ships unless all ceasefire phases are met. The Red Sea conflict raised shipping risks and costs, forcing many companies to reroute. If the truce remains effective and security improves, experts expect a gradual resumption of operations. However, as it is fragile, many question how long this ceasefire will last.</p>

          </p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">Ukraine is urging its citizens in Germany to return home as the war with Russia nears its third anniversary. Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Chernyshov announced "<a href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-22-01-2025-br2-7-unity-hubs" target="_blank">unity hubs</a>" in Berlin and other locations to aid refugees with jobs, housing, and education. Germany has hosted 1.2 million Ukrainians, with 240,000 employed by late 2024, though most women face childcare challenges. Ukraine has a shortage of workers and needs some returnees to come back to help with reconstruction. The government promises exemptions from military service for critical-sector workers to encourage repatriation. They believe Germany's support remains crucial, balancing refugee integration and voluntary return.</p>

           <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">The <a href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-22-01-2025-f1-8-world-health-organization" target="_blank">World Health Organization</a> (WHO), established in 1948 as part of the United Nations, coordinates global health efforts and has achieved significant successes, such as eradicating smallpox and reducing polio by 99%. Over time, the WHO's mission has expanded to address diverse health issues, from infectious diseases like COVID-19 to non-communicable diseases like cancer. It includes developing health guidelines, researching, and supporting vaccination programs and essential medicines.</p>
           <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">All the nations that are members of the United Nations can join the World Health Organization by <a href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-22-01-2025-f1-9-accepting-its-constitution" target="_blank">accepting its constitution</a>. For non-UN members, a separate vote will be held in the World Health Assembly to decide their membership based on the majority. Territories that are not responsible for their international relations will be admitted as Associate Members if a member state applies on behalf of the territory.</p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">For the 2024-25 year, WHO had a total budget of $6.83 billion split between universal health coverage, health emergencies, emergency operations, and appeals, among others. <a href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-22-01-2025-f1-10-who-robust-operations" target="_blank">WHO’s robust operations</a> ensured the elimination of tropical diseases, tackled mental diseases and non-communicable diseases, and advocated actions on global health threats. The organization is headed by Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of WHO, and the decision-making is led by the executive board.
