          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">Iran and Russia will sign a partnership agreement at the end of the week to define their relationship and shared strategic interests for the next twenty years. The agreement aims to boost cooperation in trade, investment, transport, logistics, and humanitarian efforts while addressing regional and global issues. It will also solidify their growing military and political partnership. Russia has signed a similar <a href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-15-01-2025-h1-1-deal-with-north-korea" target="_blank">deal with North Korea</a>, where they agreed to provide military support in the event of aggression militarily.</p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">Iran and Russia’s relationship has strengthened over the years, particularly since the 2022 war in Ukraine. Iran sent Russia self-detonating <a href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-15-01-2025-h1-2-shahed-drones" target="_blank">Shahed drones</a> for its war in Ukraine, but they downplayed its impact and the number of drones sent. Iran also allegedly sent <a href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-15-01-2025-h1-3-short-range-ballistic-missiles" target="_blank">short-range ballistic missiles</a>, which they adamantly denied. Russia did little to reciprocate regarding Iran’s proxy wars with Israel and hesitated to send Iran weapons in return.</p>

          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">Mediators are more confident that they are in the final phases of a ceasefire-hostage agreement. The US, Egypt, and Qatar have been trying to mediate an agreement for the last year with little success. The <a href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-15-01-2025-h2-4-proposed-agreement" target="_blank">proposed agreement</a> has three phases. In the first 42-day phase, Hamas will release 33 hostages, while Israel will free Palestinian prisoners in exchange. Fighting will pause, Israeli forces will withdraw from populated areas, and displaced Palestinians will begin returning home as aid flows into Gaza. The second and third phases frees the rest of the hostages, calls for complete Israeli withdrawal, and eventually starts the reconstruction in Gaza under international oversight and opening of border crossings.</p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">While all sides are <a href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-15-01-2025-h2-5-cautiously-optimistic" target="_blank">cautiously optimistic</a> about the deal, the fear looms that the conditions will be broken or the goalposts will be moved at the last minute. Israel’s ex-foreign minister said, “There will never be a perfect deal, and there never was the possibility of one – every deal will come with painful costs.” The death toll has reached over 46,000 in Gaza, and Israeli intelligence estimates that one-third of the remaining hostages are deceased, while some speculate it could be more.</p>

          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">On Tuesday, NATO leaders gathered in Helsinki, Finland, to discuss the security in the Baltic Sea. The meeting was called due to recent disruptions believed to be linked to Russia. They announced that they had launched a new mission, <a href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-15-01-2025-h3-6-baltic-sentry" target="_blank">Baltic Sentry</a>, to enhance the security of undersea cables, pipelines, and telecommunications links in the Baltic Sea. The Baltic Sentry will include frigates, maritime patrol aircraft, and a small fleet of naval drones.</p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">
          Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics recognized the challenges of providing complete protection, noting that around 2,000 ships transit the waterway daily. However, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte underlined the <a href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-15-01-2025-h3-7-importance-of-deterrence" target="_blank">importance of deterrence</a>. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz highlighted the significance of cooperation in tackling these challenges collectively. All the leaders agreed and committed to upholding regional security, countering hybrid warfare, and protecting the vital undersea networks of the Baltic Sea.

          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">After constant standoffs with authorities and investigators, impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol was arrested. This makes him the <a href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-15-01-2025-br1-8-first-sitting-president" target="_blank">first sitting president</a> in South Korea to be arrested. His arrest team, made up of over 1000 people, had to scale his barricades and cut through barbed wire to get to him while simultaneously battling it out with Yoon’s security team. He remains uncooperative and believes the warrant is not legally valid. Yoon is currently suspended and impeached by parliament. A ruling has yet to be made by South Korea’s Constitutional Court on his official removal. South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul met with Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya to discuss regional security amid the political crisis.</p>

          <strong>🇷🇸 Serbia’s double whammy</strong> 
          </p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">Serbia is facing an energy crisis in two parts. The first part is due to US sanctions on its state-owned oil and gas company, Naftna Industrija Srbije (NIS), which is majority-owned by Russia’s Gazprom. The sanctions demand the complete exit of Russian interests, threatening Serbia’s energy security. Serbia relies heavily on Russian gas but signed a deal to import 400 million cubic meters annually from Azerbaijan in 2024. However, gas supplies from Azerbaijan to Serbia were halted due to a technical issue at BP’s Shah Deniz Alpha platform, affecting Serbia’s daily <a href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-15-01-2025-br2-9-1-million-cubic-meter" target="_blank">1.7 million cubic meter</a> supply. The restart date remains unclear. Bulgaria's transit gas to Serbia temporarily replaced the shortfall with volumes from Turkey’s Botas.</p>

           <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">The <a href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-15-01-2025-f1-10-treaty-of-sevres" target="_blank">Treaty of Sevres</a> was signed on August 10, 1920. It marked the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire and imposed severe territorial, military, and economic restrictions on Turkey. The Ottoman Empire lost extensive territories, including Armenia, Syria, Iraq, Palestine, and Anatolia, which were either handed over to the Allied Powers or became mandates under the League of Nations. The agreement was supposed to form new countries, including the Republic of Armenia, the Kurdish state, and the Kingdom of Hejaz, though only Armenia was formed.

           <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">The Ottoman Empire did not agree to the terms, which led to the establishment of the <a href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-15-01-2025-f2-11-turkish-national-movement" target="_blank">Turkish National Movement</a>, led by Kemal Mustafa Ataturk. This movement aimed to overturn the Treaty of Sevres terms and conditions. This goal was achieved by October 1923, and the Republic of Turkey was proclaimed, with Kemal Ataturk as its first president. <a href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-15-01-2025-f3-12-treat-of-lausanne" target="_blank">The Treaty of Lausanne</a> subsequently replaced the Treaty of Sevres. While the Treaty of Sevres was not long-lasting, it set the course for events in the Middle East and served as a stepping stone for modern-day Turkey.
