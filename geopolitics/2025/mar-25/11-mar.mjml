          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">South Korea’s military reported on Monday that <a style="text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 2px solid  #06266D; color: black;" href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-11-03-2025-h1-1-north-korea-fired-multiple-unidentified-ballistic-missiles" target="_blank">North Korea fired multiple unidentified ballistic missiles</a>. They fired them from Hwanghae province into the West Sea. This missile launch occurred concurrently with South Korea and the US beginning their annual joint military drill. Pyongyang has consistently opposed these drills, calling them rehearsals for invasion, and routinely responds with weapons tests of its own.</p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">The drill, which the two countries describe as defensive, involves live, virtual, and field-based training and will run until March 20. Pyongyang warned that such activities could escalate tensions and lead to accidental conflict. The incident comes after a recent accident in which two South Korean Air Force fighter jets dropped bombs on a village during joint training with the US. 
       </p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">The incident injured 31 people. The relationship between North and South Korea continues to deteriorate. North Korea continues its missile tests and violation of UN sanctions. The two countries have technically been at war since their conflict ended. However, an armistice ended the conflict, not an actual peace treaty.

A specific reason wasn't given, but his independent candidacy was rejected. Georgescu called the decision a blow to democracy and claimed that Romania was under tyranny. He vowed to appeal the decision. "Europe is now a dictatorship, Romania is under tyranny!" he added. 
</p>

          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">Hundreds of his supporters clashed with police in Bucharest, attempting to breach the electoral commission's building. The protests turned violent, with protesters throwing stones and setting fire to furniture in nearby cafes. Seven arrests had been made, and 13 police officers were injured in the violence. While leading in opinion polls, Georgescu faced legal challenges.</p>

          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">Some challenges include accusations of ties to Russia and various charges such as campaign financing violations. He is also accused of promoting fascist ideologies. Despite the controversies, Georgescu's supporters are furious with the decision. US figures like Elon Musk and Vice President JD Vance have criticized the decision. They called it an attack on democratic principles and an effort to suppress the popular will.</p>

          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and tech billionaire Elon Musk feuded with Polish FM Radosław Sikorski over using Musk's Starlink satellite system in Ukraine. The debate started when Sikorski commented on Musk's post <a style="text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 2px solid  #06266D; color: black;" href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/ps-11-03-2025-h3-3-about-potentially-turning-off-the-system" target="_blank">about potentially turning off the system</a>, which provides vital internet to Ukraine, especially in war zones. Sikorski warned that if SpaceX became unreliable, Poland would seek other suppliers.</p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">The Polish government funds part of the country's 42,000 Starlink terminals. Musk angrily called Sikorski a "small man" in response. Rubio rejected Sikorski’s claims and told him to be grateful for Starlink. Polish PM Donald Tusk defended Sikorski, emphasizing respect for international partners, saying, "True leadership means respect for partners and allies. Even for the smaller and weaker ones. Never arrogance. Dear friends, think about it."</p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">Meanwhile, the ruling conservative Law and Justice party criticized Sikorski's comments. Some even suggested his Twitter presence should be reconsidered. Starlink terminals are crucial to Ukraine’s military operations. The European Commission is exploring alternatives to prevent Musk from using the service as leverage in peace talks in the future.</p>

          </p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">Supporters of Nepal's former king, Gyanendra Shah, gathered in Kathmandu. They were demanding the <a style="text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 2px solid  #06266D; color: black;" href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-11-03-2025-br1-4-reinstatement-of-the-monarchy" target="_blank">reinstatement of the monarchy</a> and the return of Hinduism as the state religion. They blocked the entrance to Tribhuvan International Airport as Gyanendra arrived from a tour of western Nepal. Despite the peaceful protests, riot police were deployed. Many Nepalis have become disillusioned with the republic because of political instability, corruption, and economic struggles.</p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">Nepal has had 13 governments since the monarchy was abolished in 2008. Gyanendra Shah became the king as a result of the royal massacre that saw nine members of the royal family murdered by the crown prince, Dipendra. Supporters of Gyanendra regret the monarchy's abolition and call for its return. While Gyanendra has not commented on the matter, his chances of regaining power remain slim.</p>

          </p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">Russia has expelled a British diplomat and the spouse of another diplomat. Russia is accusing them of "<a style="text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 2px solid  #06266D; color: black;" href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-11-03-2025-br2-5-intelligence-and-subversive-work" target="_blank">intelligence and subversive work.</a>" The Federal Security Service (FSB) stripped them of their accreditation and gave them two weeks to leave the country. The UK Foreign Office dismissed the accusations as baseless.</p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">This move followed a series of diplomatic expulsions between the two countries. The UK expelled a Russian diplomat last month in response to Moscow’s actions in 2024. Diplomatic ties between the UK and Russia have soured since Russia invaded Ukraine. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is leading efforts to support Ukraine and pledging to increase defense spending.</p>

          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">Poland contributes the most to <a style="text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 2px solid  #06266D; color: black;" href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-11-03-2025-f1-6-natos-military-budget" target="_blank">NATO’s military budget</a>, percentage-wise than all the members of the NATO BLOC. In 2024, it contributed over 4%, has vowed to commit to over 5%, and has urged other Europeans to do the same. Poland has been a strong contributor to NATO’s operations in regions such as Afghanistan, Iraq, and Kosovo.
</p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">
          While it has been critical of Donald Trump’s policies toward Ukraine, it still has tried to stay in the US’s good graces compared to other European countries. Poland has an extensive history of invasions and occupations, especially during and after World War II. These invasions have made Poland protective of its sovereignty and security. Poland was under Soviet influence for much of the Cold War and suffered during the period when it was part of the Warsaw Pact. </p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">The end of the Cold War and the fall of the Soviet Union left Poland eager to avoid repeating history. Poland also has strong ties to the Polish-American community, so the transatlantic connection is also instilled. This community is one of the largest and most influential immigrant groups in the United States, and their ties to Poland remain strong in various aspects.</p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">Polish Americans advocated for Polish causes during the Cold War. Poland's location in the heart of Central Europe, bordering Germany to the west and Russia (via Kaliningrad) to the east, is strategically crucial for NATO’s defense strategy. It sees itself as one of the frontlines of defense if Russia attacks the European Union.</p>
