The Ukrainian delegation, led by Yermak, met with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and White House Special Envoy Steve Witkoff. They discussed ways to end Russia's ongoing war. Andriy Yermak, head of President Zelenskyy's office, expressed optimism, calling the discussions "constructive."</p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">The US approach focused on listening to Ukraine's peace conditions rather than proposing solutions. Rubio emphasized the need to explore potential compromises between Kyiv and Moscow. One possible proposal from Ukraine includes a ceasefire in the Black Sea region. Another point of negotiation could involve rare-earth mineral deals. The agreement could provide Ukraine access to mineral wealth in exchange for US funding.
       </p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">Ukrainian outlet Suspilne reported that the parties "have already discussed a ceasefire at sea and in the sky, as well as a deal on minerals." The outcome of these talks is still very up in the air. Russia demands Ukraine abandon its NATO ambitions and recognize Russian-occupied territories. Ukraine insists on strong security guarantees. The US might restore aid and intel sharing with Ukraine after the meeting.

          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">Greenland’s parliamentary elections took place yesterday. The center-right <a style="text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 2px solid  #06266D; color: black;" href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-12-03-2025-h2-2-demokraatit-party-garnered-the-most-votes" target="_blank">Demokraatit Party garnered the most votes</a>. Both Demokraatit and the runner-up party Naleraq favor independence from Denmark. This victory establishes that the people of Greenland care about healthcare, education, cultural heritage, and other social policies. While the election results are in, certification will take weeks.
</p>

          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">Prime Minister Mute Bourup Egede called for early elections, citing the need for the country to unite during a crucial time. These election results show Greenland is at a crossroads with Denmark and the US. Four out of five parties contested wanted independence, but the path to freedom will depend on Demokraatit’s decision to form a coalition government and, if so, with which party.</p>

          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">Trump has previously expressed his interest in controlling Greenland. This would provide better security to the US and allow them to hold rare earth minerals vital to the global economy. Meanwhile, opinion polls suggest most Greenlanders favor independence. They also reject becoming part of the US despite friendly ties with the Pituffik Space Base.</p>

          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">Syria’s Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have agreed to <a style="text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 2px solid  #06266D; color: black;" href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-12-03-2025-h3-3-integrate-their-autonomous-institutions-into-the-syrian-government" target="_blank">integrate their autonomous institutions into the Syrian government</a>. The agreement transfers border checkpoints and oil and gas field control to Damascus and guarantees Kurds constitutional rights, including citizenship and linguistic freedoms. SDF leader Mazloum Abdi called it a “real opportunity to build a new Syria.” The interim President, Ahmed al-Sharaa, emphasized Kurdish inclusion.</p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">The agreement follows years of Kurdish self-rule after government forces withdrew in 2011. The SDF, dominated by the People's Protection Units (YPG), played a crucial role in defeating ISIS. It was previously excluded from national dialogue efforts over its refusal to disarm. The agreement comes after jailed Kurdish insurgent leader Abdullah Ocalan urged the PKK to end its armed struggle against Turkey.</p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">It remains unclear how this integration will affect regional stability. Especially since Turkey opposes the SDF’s ties to YPG. There are also ongoing issues between Kurdish forces, Damascus, and external powers. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that more than 1,000 civilians were killed in the clashes.</p>

          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">Former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte was detained after the International Criminal Court (ICC) <a style="text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 2px solid  #06266D; color: black;" href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-12-03-2025-br1-4-issued-a-warrant-for-his-alleged-crimes-against-humanity" target="_blank">issued a warrant for his alleged crimes against humanity</a> linked to his deadly “war on drugs.” He was taken into custody at Manila Airport after returning from Hong Kong. Duterte told police that he should be put on trial in a court in the Philippines. Duterte’s crackdown led to an estimated 12,000 to 30,000 deaths, primarily of poor civilians.</p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">Human rights groups welcomed his arrest as a step toward justice. His supporters called it unlawful. During his presidency, Duterte openly encouraged police to kill drug suspects and claimed to have led a “death squad” as mayor of Davao. President Ferdinand Marcos’s administration may cooperate with the ICC.</p>

          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to <a style="text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 2px solid  #06266D; color: black;" href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-12-03-2025-br2-5-release-foreign-aid-payments" target="_blank">release foreign aid payments</a> under existing contracts. He did not block mass contract cancellations. Judge Amir Ali ruled that the US must pay USAID bills owed through Feb. 13 and barred the government from unlawfully impounding aid. However, he upheld a review that led to 10,000 USAID and State Department award cancellations.</p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">USAID contractors and nonprofits sued. They argued that Trump's aid freeze violated congressional authority and caused severe harm. They claimed the review was rushed and effectively halted aid unlawfully. The government insisted it conducted an individualized assessment. Ali ruled that withholding appropriated funds likely violated the separation of powers.</p>

        <strong>Every successful company has a turning point</strong>—a risk that paid off, a product that redefined an industry, or a decision that changed everything.

          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">Dagestan is situated in Russia's North Caucasus. It is famous for its <a style="text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 2px solid  #06266D; color: black;" href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-12-03-2025-f1-6-ethnic-and-linguistic-diversity" target="_blank">ethnic and linguistic diversity</a>, with over 30 languages spoken. It is the only republic in Russia not named after an ethnicity. The region shares borders with Chechnya, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and the Caspian Sea. It is home to various Muslim ethnic groups, including Avars, Dargins, Kumyks, and Lezgins. 
</p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">
          The republic has significant natural resources, including oil, gas, and fisheries. It mainly benefits from its share of the Caspian Sea’s resources. However, it also faces high levels of organized crime and regional instability and has one of the highest unemployment rates in Russia. Dagestan has a complex history. It is the birthplace of Imam Shamil, who led resistance to the Russian Empire.</p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">In the 1920s, it became an autonomous Soviet republic and remained loyal to Russia after the Soviet Union collapsed. In the 1990s, Dagestan saw attacks from separatist groups and Islamic militants. Some of these continue. Protests erupted in 2022 against Russia's involvement in the Ukraine war. Dagestan was also in the news in 2024 for mass attacks on churches and synagogues.</p>
