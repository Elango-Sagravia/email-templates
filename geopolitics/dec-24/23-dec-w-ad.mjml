          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">The Cuban government and citizens <a href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-23-dec-2024-1-protested" target="_blank">protested</a> in front of the U.S. Embassy on Friday over the trade sanctions. President Miguel Díaz-Canel and former leader Raúl Castro led the protest. The protestors are calling for an end to the U.S. trade embargo, which is blamed for the severe economic challenges Cuba faces, and for an end to U.S. interference. The Cuban government argues that the embargo has disabled the country’s economy, worsening shortages and limiting growth.</p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">President Díaz-Canel criticized Biden for upholding Trump’s policies instead of removing them, including designating Cuba a state sponsor of terrorism, which isolates it financially. While US sanctions play a role in Cuba’s worsening economy, some also say they are often overused as an excuse to cover up the government's failings. The Cuban president has, however, come out before to take some <a href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-23-dec-2024-2-partial-blame" target="_blank">partial blame</a>. The situation will likely not improve with Trump’s return to the White House.​</p>

Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs called it “dangerous moves that undermine peace and stability.” China also added that the US is crossing a major redline. Tensions have been heating up more recently, with China conducting <a href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-23-dec-2024-4-military-activities" target="_blank">military activities</a> near Taiwan, including large-scale maritime drills and regular aerial and naval operations.</p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">President Joe Biden announced shortly before leaving office that the United States had approved $571.3 million in military aid for Taiwan. The package includes defense articles, services, and training, though specific details remain undisclosed. This follows a $567 million package authorized just three months ago. Taiwan received 38 tanks earlier this week, its first new tank in 30 years. Taiwan thanked the U.S. for its support and reaffirmed its commitment to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.​</p>

They originated in the 1990s as a movement advocating for the rights of Yemen's Zaydi Shia minority but evolved into a powerful insurgent force. They took their name from its late founder Hussein al-Houthi and is now led by his brother Abdul Malik al-Houthi.​</p>
           <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">They are one of Iran's proxies to help it fight against Israel, and they also serve as a proxy for its conflict with Saudi Arabia. Although Iran claims only to be supporting them politically and not economically, specialists say it would be impossible for them to have advanced as much as they have without military and economic support from Iran.​</p>
