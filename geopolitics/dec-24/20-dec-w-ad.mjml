          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">The ousting of Assad has put Russia in a complicated predicament. Russia previously said it was going to step back from Syria, but not away ultimately. However, the new transitional government has told Russia to <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2024/12/16/theres-no-reason-for-russian-troop-presence-in-syria-syrias-new-transitional-government" target="_blank">reconsider</a> its troops there. It has not overruled having relations with any country but wants to distance itself from those close to Assad. The transitional government also mentioned that it is open to dialogue with all countries to lay the new Syrian future.</p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">Russia has depended on the Khmeimim Air Base and the Tartus Naval Base as they provide crucial access to the Mediterranean. Now, Russian troops have been massively withdrawn from Syria, and there is <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/russian-military-moving-from-syria-to-libya/a-71097602" target="_blank">speculation</a> that they could move a lot of their military presence to Libya. This brings a new era and set of challenges. Suppose Russia moves its military bases to Libya, it brings about a new recalibration of Russia’s strategy toward North Africa. It could lead to intensified competition with NATO and a potential escalation of conflict in Libya.​</p>

          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">Iran is in an undesirable <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/18/iran-key-services-shut-as-rial-plunges-amid-energy-crisis-regional" target="_blank">situation</a>. It suffers from a significant energy and economic crisis, made worse by regional tensions, harsh winters, and a plummeting currency. Many of Tehran's key services have been shut off. Despite being home to the second-largest natural gas reserve, many problems are due to mismanagement, outdated infrastructure, and international sanctions. These have led to unplanned blackouts, worsened public health, and billions in economic losses.</p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">Iran has dealt with many blows this year. It has engaged with <a href="https://theconversation.com/amid-lull-in-tit-for-tat-missile-exchange-iran-and-israel-seek-to-control-the-online-narrative-242265" target="_blank">Israel</a>, and the downfall of <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/13/nx-s1-5223675/the-collapse-of-the-assad-regime-in-syria-has-been-a-huge-blow-for-iran" target="_blank">Assad</a> has been a geopolitical disaster. Iran also faces a lot of <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/iranians-upset-with-tehran-over-israel-tensions/a-70608764" target="_blank">internal tension</a> and pressure. Many people are dissatisfied with the government for multitudes of reasons; they are tired of the conflict with Israel and dissatisfied with the regime in general. There have been massive protests and opposition that were squashed immediately.  Things are likely to worsen with Donald Trump as president in 2025. His last presidency <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/6/29/iran-and-us-president-donald-trump-a-timeline-of-key-events" target="_blank">worsened</a> the Iranian-US relations.​</p>

          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">With just a couple of months ahead of the German elections, Alternative for Germany (AfD) has made a case for "<a href="https://www.dw.com/en/far-right-afd-party-wants-germany-to-leave-the-eu/a-71093400" target="_blank">Dexit</a>," which means Germany's withdrawal from the European Union (EU) and the eurozone. This shows the expansion of the AfD's nationalist and Euroskeptic stance despite widespread opposition from the German public, economic experts, and industry leaders. The AfD has some alternatives, such as "Europe of Fatherlands," a loose economic and interest community with a shared market but no overarching EU institutions.</p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">Germany is one of the EU's most significant members and its economic center. While this would be an unthinkable move, the likelihood of it happening is relatively low because German EU membership is anchored in its constitution. Germans, even those who vote right-wing, are <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/eu-nato-growing-in-popularity-in-germany/a-68749726" target="_blank">pro-EU</a>. Movements like this are also gaining ground in the <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/hungary-and-the-netherlands-want-to-exit-eu-asylum-policy/a-70278674" target="_blank">Benelux</a> and <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/18/france-elections-emmanuel-macron-european-union-debt-economy-inflation-unemployment/" target="_blank">France</a>.</p>

Trump even <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113666067546631826" target="_blank">called</a> Prime Minister Justin Trudeau the “Governor of Canada.” It was poorly timed, as Canada is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/17/trump-trudeau-chrystia-freeland-canada-00194783" target="_blank">dealing</a> with a political crisis.

          Israel's plan to <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2024/12/15/israel-approves-plans-to-up-golan-heights-settler-numbers-as-new-front-opens-in-syria" target="_blank">increase</a> settler numbers in the Golan Heights has drawn sharp criticism amid Syria's ongoing instability following the fall of President Bashar al-Assad. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a $ 10.3 million initiative to double settler numbers in territory annexed in 1981. While Netanyahu emphasized that Israel seeks no conflict with Syria, the plan was condemned by Saudi Arabia and Qatar as a violation of international law and a threat to regional stability.  While this plan doesn’t go that far out of Israel’s borders, the expansion plays into what many call the “Greater Israel" plan.</p>

           <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">"Greater Israel" refers to a concept that some people believe or advocate for regarding the <a href="https://theweek.com/world-news/what-is-the-greater-israel-movement" target="_blank">territorial expansion</a> of the State of Israel. It is most often associated with the idea that Israel should control a larger area than it currently does, encompassing all or parts of territories biblically significant to Jews. Some include the West Bank and parts of neighboring countries like Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria.​</p>
           <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">Critics of this concept say it undermines the right to a Palestinian state and turns the peace process upside down. Also, this term has been used by anti-semitic people to play into <a href="https://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/conspiracy-myths/the-myth-that-jews-control-the-world" target="_blank">conspiracy theories</a> claiming the Jewish people own the world.  It's important to note that "Greater Israel" is not an official policy of the Israeli government but rather a viewpoint held by specific right-wing and religious groups.​</p>
