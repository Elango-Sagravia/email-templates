          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">Lithuania’s parliamentary elections on Sunday saw the <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/lithuania-opposition-social-democrats-win-election/a-70611400" target="_blank">center-left Social Democrats</a> (SD) take a solid lead. They are likely to form a coalition with other parties, focusing on economic issues like the rising cost of living and social inequality while maintaining a robust stance on national security against perceived threats from Russia. The ruling Homeland Union took a downturn as it was under pressure as public dissatisfaction grew over inflation rates that have surpassed 20% and widening socioeconomic gaps.</p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">A significant portion of the electorate, especially given Lithuania’s proximity to Russia and the Belarusian alliance, is concerned about potential military aggression. Approximately three-quarters of Lithuanians believe an attack from Russia is possible in the near future. The situation regarding <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2023/10/24/the-story-of-how-a-small-eu-state-like-lithuania-took-on-world-superpower-china" target="_blank">China and Lithuania</a> could change the new parliament, as the previous government took a bold and “no-nonsense approach,” which adversely affected its economy.</p>

In Dnipro, five individuals, including a child, were killed, and more than a dozen were injured, with several buildings, among them a hospital, suffering significant damage. Photos shared by officials depicted extensive wreckage and damaged hospital rooms with shattered windows. In Kyiv, separate strikes caused two fatalities, including a teenage girl in a drone attack on an apartment.</p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">The attacks happened just a couple of days after Russia hosted the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/22/russias-brics-summit-whats-on-the-agenda-and-why-does-it-matter" target="_blank">BRICS summit</a> in Kazan, where President Vladimir Putin faced international pressure to end hostilities. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky emphasized that the strikes highlighted the failure of negotiations and called for more robust defense measures. These assaults come as Kyiv braces for a brutal winter characterized by increased Russian attacks on energy infrastructure.</p>

Satellite images confirmed the damage, including the destruction of a building known as “Taleghan 2,” associated with past nuclear tests. Iran reported casualties among air defense personnel but did not acknowledge the damage. The strikes follow recent <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-news-10-01-2024-eb175dff6e46906caea8b9e43dfbd3da" target="_blank">missile attacks</a> from Iran, with Israel claiming its assault disrupted missile production capabilities. The strikes resulted in the deaths of four Iranian military personnel, while Israel emphasized that it did not target energy infrastructure. </p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">Tensions keep escalating, with Iran vowing to respond “decisively and appropriately” to any future violations of its sovereignty (<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-lebanon-gaza-war-10-26-24/index.html" target="_blank">latest updates</a>). The <a href="https://www.deccanherald.com/world/un-security-council-expected-to-meet-monday-over-israels-strike-on-iran-3251091" target="_blank">UN Security Council</a> is set to meet following Israel’s recent airstrikes on Iranian military targets, a response to Tehran’s earlier missile attacks. Iran’s UN delegation has requested the meeting, arguing that Israel’s actions violated international law. In response, Israel asserts its right to self-defense and dismisses Iran’s accusations. </p>

Former Prime Minister Boyko Borisov’s center-right GERB party secured the most votes, with exit polls estimating 26.4 percent, but failed to achieve a majority. The reformist “We Continue The Change” followed with 14.9 percent, while the far-right Revival Party, with pro-Russian leanings, gained 12.9 percent. Low voter turnout remains a challenge, and GERB will need a coalition to govern. This marks the sixth attempt to establish a stable government since anti-corruption protests in 2020 brought down Borisov’s previous administration.</p>

With a majority requiring 233 seats, the LDP will likely need to form a coalition, possibly with its current partner, Komeito. This election, called by new leader Shigeru Ishiba, follows a series of scandals and declining approval ratings. Voter apathy remains high, as many citizens express dissatisfaction with the party’s handling of economic issues, including rising living costs and political corruption.</p>

          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">The Marshall Plan, formally known as the <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/marshall-plan-1" target="_blank">European Recovery Program</a>, was an ambitious U.S. initiative launched in April 1948 to aid European nations in their recovery after the devastation of World War II. Secretary of State George C. Marshall proposed allocating over $13 billion (equivalent to more than $150 billion today) to rebuild war-torn economies, restore infrastructure, and stabilize currencies. It aimed to prevent the spread of communism by fostering economic prosperity and encouraging political stability.</p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">The aid was distributed among 16 Western European countries, which saw remarkable growth and modernization, boosting trade and cooperation. By 1952, participating nations had significantly recovered, marking the plan as one of history's most successful foreign aid programs. The Marshall Plan helped rebuild Europe and laid the groundwork for long-term political alliances, including establishing the European Economic Community.</p>
