          <p style="font-size:18px;line-height:1.6;">On October 6, Kazakhstan held a referendum where 71.12% of voters supported building the nation’s first <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/astana-nuclear-kazakh/33148851.html" target="_blank">nuclear power plant</a>. The project is crucial for addressing energy shortages and geopolitical challenges, with <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/kazakhstan-faces-legacy-soviet-weapons-testing-referendum-nuclear-114538102" target="_blank">Russia’s state atomic agency</a> Rosatom likely to be a key partner. However, concerns emerged over media bias, limited public debate, and the detention of activists. Observers reported irregularities, such as ballot stuffing and pressure on independent monitors. Despite the vote, the nuclear plant won’t address Kazakhstan’s immediate energy crisis, as construction will take years to complete.</p>
          <p style="font-size:18px;line-height:1.6;">Kazakhstan is a peculiar geopolitical crossroads due to its location in Central Asia. While Kazakstan has been in Russia’s geopolitical sphere, some concerns have been raised, particularly since the War in Ukraine. However, with some growing dissatisfaction, Kazakhstan is still under much <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/2024/02/russias-influence-kazakhstan-increasing-despite-war-ukraine" target="_blank">Russian influence</a>.</p>

          <h2 style="font-size:20px;line-height:1.2;font-weight:700;">Mexican Mayor Murdered</h2>
        </mj-text>
        <mj-text padding="10px 12px" font-family="EB Garamond" color="#000000">
          <p style="font-size:18px;line-height:1.6;">Alejandro Arcos, the new mayor of Chilpancingo, Guerrero, was tragically <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8dj0833g99o" target="_blank">murdered just six days after taking office</a>. His assassination highlights the rampant drug violence plaguing the region, which is notorious for cartel activity. Just days before, the city’s secretary, Francisco Tapia, was also killed, intensifying concerns about the safety of public officials. Following Arcos’s death, state Governor Evelyn Salgado expressed outrage and mourning while calls for federal authorities to step in became louder. </p>
          <p style="font-size:18px;line-height:1.6;">Guerrero has seen a shocking number of political killings, reflecting the dangerous intersection of corruption and drug trafficking in Mexico. Since the military’s deployment against drug cartels in 2006, over 450,000 people have been murdered nationwide. The situation remains dire, and local leaders are increasingly targeted as they try to serve their communities amid ongoing violence.</p>

        </mj-text>
        <mj-text padding="10px 12px" font-family="EB Garamond" color="#000000">
          <p style="font-size:18px;line-height:1.6;">A massive explosion rocked <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/chinese-workers-killed-in-karachi-blast/a-70418754" target="_blank">Karachi Airport</a> in Pakistan late Sunday night, leading to the tragic deaths of two people and injuring several others. The Chinese embassy confirmed that the casualties included two Chinese nationals who were part of a convoy targeted in what officials are calling a “terrorist attack.” The explosion was linked to an improvised explosive device (IED), highlighting concerns about the safety of foreign workers engaged in significant projects like the <a href="https://multimedia.scmp.com/news/china/article/One-Belt-One-Road/pakistan.html" target="_blank">Belt and Road Initiative</a>.</p>
          <p style="font-size:18px;line-height:1.6;">The blast was heard for miles, and local media reported flames engulfing several vehicles. Fortunately, airport operations continued without disruption, and officials stated that flights remained on schedule. This incident raises serious questions about security and safety in the region, especially for foreign nationals working in Pakistan. It also raises further questions about whether Pakistan can handle its separatist issues.</p>

          <p style="font-size:18px;line-height:1.6;">South Korea and the Philippines have officially elevated their relationship to a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/philippines-korea-yoon-marcos-security-strategic-07ff92e4f6030232739142a1829b2acb" target="_blank">strategic partnership</a>, enhancing defense and security cooperation amid rising regional tensions. During a state visit, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. agreed to bolster collaboration between their coast guards and modernize the Philippine military.</p>
          <p style="font-size:18px;line-height:1.6;">The discussions included concerns about <a href="https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/territorial-disputes-south-china-sea" target="_blank">territorial disputes</a> in the South China Sea and <a href="https://www.geopolitics.world/archives/one-year-of-hamas-attack-north-korea-nuclear-threats-hong-kong-surveillance" target="_blank">tensions with North Korea</a>. Marcos emphasized the need for collaboration to ensure prosperity and uphold international law in an increasingly complex geopolitical landscape. Yoon reiterated the importance of peace in the South China Sea and condemned North Korea’s nuclear ambitions and military ties with Russia. This partnership addresses shared security challenges as President Yoon continues his Southeast Asia tour.</p>

          <p style="font-size:18px;line-height:1.6;">Tunisian President Kais Saied has secured a staggering 90.7% of the vote in a recent <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/ap/ap-international/ap-tunisias-president-saied-wins-landslide-reelection-after-cracking-down-on-opponents/" target="_blank">election</a> held amid a campaign that saw many opponents jailed. The Independent High Authority for Elections reported a low voter turnout of just 28.8%, primarily due to boycotts by those opposing Saied’s rule. His nearest rival, Ayachi Zammel, garnered 7.4% of the vote while imprisoned during the campaign.</p>
        </mj-text>
        <mj-text padding="10px 12px" font-family="EB Garamond" color="#000000">
          <p style="font-size:18px;line-height:1.6;">Since taking office, Saied has dismantled democratic institutions and suppressed civil society, with numerous political figures jailed on various charges. This election marks Tunisia’s ongoing struggle since the 2011 Arab Spring, which initially brought hope for a democratic future. Young Tunisians are leaving the country in large numbers, which puts the country at risk for a significant <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20241005-as-more-young-tunisians-look-away-from-politics-many-wish-to-live-abroad" target="_blank">brain drain</a> in the future.</p>

          <p style="font-size:18px;line-height:1.6;">Euroskeptic parties have gained power since <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887" target="_blank">Brexit</a> in 2016, stirring up conversations about whether countries can be kicked out for not following EU rules. Hungary and Poland have recently faced criticism for actions that clash with EU values, leading to debates about how the EU might handle a member state that doesn’t meet its standards.</p>
          <p style="font-size:18px;line-height:1.6;">So, is it possible? The short answer is yes, but it is close to impossible. </p>
          <p style="font-size:18px;line-height:1.6;"><a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/topics/en/article/20180222STO98434/breaches-of-eu-values-how-the-eu-can-act-infographic" target="_blank">Article 7 of the Treaty</a> on the European Union allows the EU to sanction a member state for breaching fundamental values, like democracy and the rule of law. However, this requires a unanimous vote from other member states. In theory, if a country persistently violates EU values and fails to comply, it could face suspension of rights or even expulsion, but such actions have never been implemented. Due to the unanimous vote, in a case like Hungary or Poland, they are more than likely to have their fellow Central European countries on their side. A country is much more likely to get frustrated and leave on its own before it could logistically happen.</p>
