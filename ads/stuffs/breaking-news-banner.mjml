            ">A regional passenger airline, American Airlines Flight 5342, and a military black hawk collided over Washington D.C., marking it the major commercial airline crash since 2009. Fatalities are being reported, and rescue missions are underway. The flight carried a total of 60 passengers and 4 crew members while the three army soldiers were aboard the Black Hawk helicopter (<a href="https://link.presidentialsummary.com/ps-30-01-2025-h1-1-follow-live-updates" target="_blank">follow live updates</a>).</p>

            ">A multi-agency search-and-rescue operation is underway. The mission will be challenging as accessibility remains an issue with freezing temperatures and cold winds. 12 bodies were recovered from the river, and no survivors have been reported yet. The passengers list included figure skating athletes, coaches, and family members who had been at a development camp in Wichita. President Trump said the plane collision "looks like it should have been prevented."</p>
