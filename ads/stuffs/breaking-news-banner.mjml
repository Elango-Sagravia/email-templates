            ">A multi-agency search-and-rescue operation is underway. The mission will be challenging as accessibility remains an issue with freezing temperatures and cold winds. 12 bodies were recovered from the river, and no survivors have been reported yet. The passengers list included figure skating athletes, coaches, and family members who had been at a development camp in Wichita. President Trump said the plane collision "looks like it should have been prevented."</p>
