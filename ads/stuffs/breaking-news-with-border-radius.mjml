        and the first Latin American Pope, passed away on Easter Monday. He had
        been struggling with a series of health problems, including double
        pneumonia, for which he spent five weeks in the hospital. “This morning
        at 7:35 am CEST, the Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the home of
        the Father," said Cardinal Kevin Farrell.

        Pope Francis blessed crowds in St Peter’s Square on Easter Sunday. He
        called for freedom of thought and tolerance in his Easter Sunday
        address. "There can be no peace without freedom of religion, freedom of
        thought, freedom of expression, and respect for the views of others,"
        his speech read.
