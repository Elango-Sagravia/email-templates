With backing from insurers like Axa and Axis Capital, and Banco Santander structuring the deal, IDB hopes this model will scale up lending capacity for poverty alleviation and environmental protection in the region.</p>

Elliott argues that Citgo’s assets are losing value and no better offers are likely to surface.

Citgo is at the heart of a U.S. auction to satisfy Venezuela’s $21 billion in defaults.
