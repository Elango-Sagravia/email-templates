The race between Trump and Harris is tight, pushing gold close to its all-time high of $2,685. With central banks buying heavily and the potential for Fed rate cuts, gold’s appeal is growing. Market forecasts suggest the metal could reach $2,917 by next year. Even as the dollar strengthens, gold’s performance remains impressive, up 30% in 2024.</p>

          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">Doug Ostrover, co-CEO of Blue Owl Capital, believes asset-based lending is the next big thing in private credit. As regional banks pull back, private lenders like Blue Owl are stepping in, targeting markets backed by assets like equipment and consumer loans. The potential is huge, with the market <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/10/16/blue-owl-co-ceo-sees-asset-based-finance-as-next-big-boom/" target="_blank">valued</a> at $6 trillion. Blue Owl recently expanded its reach by acquiring Atalaya Capital Management and securing a $2 billion deal with fintech lender Upstart. This space is primed for growth as private lenders capitalize on the opportunities left by traditional banks.</p>

Currency markets are seeing a surge in options trading, with funds targeting the yuan, Mexican peso, and euro. Trump’s tough stance on tariffs could push the greenback higher, and hedge funds are positioning themselves for gains. As election day nears, demand for dollar options is rising.

The move is crucial for GM’s electric vehicle strategy, as lithium is a key component in EV batteries. Thacker Pass is expected to produce 40,000 metric tons of lithium annually, and GM will take a 38% stake in the project. Despite falling lithium prices, GM is pushing forward with its EV plans, while other automakers, like Ford, have scaled back. This investment strengthens GM’s position in the EV race.</p>

          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">Hedge fund allocators are growing concerned about crowding as they consolidate portfolios into fewer, larger funds. A new Bank of America survey <a href="https://www.hedgeweek.com/crowding-is-major-hedge-fund-allocator-concern/" target="_blank">found</a> that investors are moving away from diversification, instead favoring big multi-manager funds like Millennium and Citadel. Despite concerns, multi-strategy funds continue to attract inflows, totaling $10 billion in 2024. The trend has some worried that concentrated positions could amplify risk in volatile markets. However, allocators are using their increased leverage to negotiate better terms with hedge fund managers, making this a buyers’ market for institutional investors.</p>

Funds like Legacy Capital and Ace Capital posted their best returns of the year as Brazil's fiscal outlook fueled rising swap rates. Hedge funds are skeptical about the government's ability to stabilize public debt, which has led to increased pessimism on domestic assets. An index tracking Brazil's hedge funds rose 1.1% last month, outpacing the broader benchmark. Despite challenges, these funds are finding opportunities in the country’s uncertain fiscal environment.</p>
