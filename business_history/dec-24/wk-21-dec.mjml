          Howard Schultz, the visionary CEO of Starbucks, wasn’t actually the founder. He joined the company in 1982 as head of marketing, working under Jerry Baldwin, Gordon Bowker, and Zev Siegl- the original founders. At the time, Starbucks wasn’t a café but a retailer of premium coffee beans, teas, and brewing equipment, drawing inspiration from <strong>Alfred Peet</strong>, the founder of <a href="https://www.peets.com/pages/timeline" target="_blank">Peet's Coffee</a>. Peet was a pioneer in the coffee industry, known for his commitment to high-quality beans and his dark roast technique. Starbucks followed suit by opening its first coffee bean retail store at Pike Place Market in 1971.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">
          Schultz’s introduction to Starbucks came in 1981 when he was working as the general manager of <strong>Hammarplast</strong>, a Swedish company that manufactured household plastics. He noticed Starbucks placing huge orders for drip coffee makers and was intrigued by their success. His curiosity led him to Seattle, where he met the founders. Schultz was captivated not just by the aroma of freshly roasted coffee beans but by the founders’ passion for sourcing quality beans, their meticulous roasting process, and their commitment to educating customers about coffee appreciation. The experience left such a profound impression that he was determined to join the company.</p>

          It took Schultz a year to convince the Starbucks founders to hire him. During a business trip to Milan in 1983, he realized that Italian coffeehouses weren’t just places to grab a quick espresso—they were community hubs where people connected and savored life. With baristas making coffee art to the tunes of Italian Opera, the vibrant culture was strong, and the people knew each other by name. This culture was worlds apart from the primarily functional and transactional way Americans consumed coffee. Schultz saw an untapped opportunity– to bring the Italian coffee culture to the US, a chance to transform coffee drinking into an experience. This would later become his life’s mission.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">
          Inspired, Schultz proposed expanding Starbucks beyond its original business model. But the founders were hesitant. They wanted to focus on selling coffee beans and equipment, not running cafés. Schultz’s idea seemed risky, even unnecessary. Yet, they tested this idea in one of the locations in downtown Seattle and served the now <strong>iconic Caffè Latte</strong> and were met with success. But the founders simply didn’t share his vision. Undeterred, Schultz made a bold decision.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">
          He left Starbucks and launched his own venture, <a href="https://archive.starbucks.com/record/il-giornale" target="_blank">Il Giornale</a>, a coffee shop modeled after the Italian café experience. Think espresso, comfy seating, newspapers, and an open invitation to stay as long as you like. Despite the success of Il Giornale, Schultz couldn’t shake his fascination with Starbucks. In 1987, when the Starbucks founders decided to sell the company, Schultz, with the backing of investors like Bill Gates’s father, swooped in, bought the company, and merged it with Il Giornale. And the rest is history.</p>

           Schultz envisioned coffee culture as a ritual, a medium for connection, an experience, and a lifestyle. He built Starbucks around that vision, transforming it into a cultural institution. His belief in sharing success with the people and community made him create two landmark programs. Starbucks offered comprehensive health coverage to all its employees, even part-timers, which was unheard of at the time. He also offered Bean Stocks, which provided equity in the form of stock to his employees.</p>
           <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">
          Under Schultz’s leadership, Starbucks redefined coffee as an affordable luxury and established itself as the “third place” between home and work. The company consistently pushed boundaries with innovative flavors, seasonal offerings, and creative product lines. Strategic expansion, backed by careful analysis of population density, income levels, and foot traffic, allowed Starbucks to grow without cannibalizing its business. Starbucks stood the test of time by risking more than what others think is safe and by growing above its mistakes.</p>
