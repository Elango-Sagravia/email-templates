          Google embarked on an exciting journey in the early 2000s to become the dominant force in internet advertising that it is today. At the time, the business was engaged in fierce competition with Overture, a reputable and well-funded participant in the rapidly expanding advertising industry. Google's creative solution to this problem, AdWords, was encountering its own difficulties. The team was a little frustrated because the algorithm wasn't doing as well as they had intended.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">
          One of Google's creative co-founders, Larry Page, was not afraid to take on new tasks. "<strong>These ads suck</strong>," he wrote candidly on a note he put up in the office kitchen. The staff as a whole was motivated to adopt a culture of creativity and problem-solving by this clear message, which was more than just a criticism. Instead of assigning blame, it urged everyone to critically examine the situation as it stands and work together to make improvements.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">Jeff Dean, who wasn't formally a member of the AdWords team, took charge. Roles were fluid in Google's collaborative atmosphere, enabling talent to shine wherever it was needed. The problem inspired Dean, who decided to improve the faltering algorithm. He put all of his energy into a thorough refurbishment over the course of one weekend. When Monday arrived, the change was astounding: AdWords started to show profitable, relevant, and targeted advertisements.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">This crucial event not only put AdWords on a prosperous path but also improved Google overall. Because of the increased efficiency brought about by these upgrades, Google was able to surpass Overture.</p>
