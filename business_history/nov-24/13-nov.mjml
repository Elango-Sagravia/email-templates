          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter was one of the most talked-about deals in recent tech history. It all began in early 2022, when Musk, known for his outspoken nature on Twitter, expressed his dissatisfaction with the platform’s stance on free speech. Musk tweeted a poll, asking his followers if they believed Twitter adhered to the principles of free speech. He followed up, suggesting starting his social media platform. But what came next was unexpected—a series of moves that led him not to create a new platform but to buy one of the world’s most influential social networks.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">In early April 2022, Musk quietly bought a significant stake in Twitter, amassing over 9% of the company’s shares, quickly making him Twitter’s largest shareholder. This sudden ownership shift prompted speculation and buzz, and soon after, Musk accepted an invitation to join Twitter’s board of directors. He changed his mind and declined the offer just days later, setting the stage for a far bolder move. Musk then proposed to buy Twitter outright for $44 billion, offering $54.20 per share—a nod to his history of playful references to “420,” often associated with cannabis culture. This offer sent shockwaves through the tech and finance sectors, as many wondered if Musk was serious.</p>

          <mj-text padding="10px 12px" font-family="Roboto+Serif" color="#000000">
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">Twitter initially resisted Musk’s bid, even attempting to employ a “poison pill” strategy. This defense mechanism would make it more difficult for Musk to acquire more shares and push the buyout through. However, after Musk laid out his vision for Twitter, emphasizing his focus on freedom of speech and reducing bot activity, Twitter’s board finally agreed to his offer. Twitter’s CEO at the time, Parag Agrawal, initially appeared supportive, but behind the scenes, tensions were rising.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">The road to finalizing the acquisition could have been smoother. Over the next few months, Musk expressed concerns about the number of fake accounts on Twitter, claiming the platform had a “bot problem.” He even hinted at pulling out of the deal, citing Twitter’s alleged failure to provide accurate data on fake accounts. Twitter, meanwhile, pushed back, insisting that Musk’s claims were unfounded and that the agreement bound him. This dispute ultimately led to a high-stakes legal battle, with Twitter filing a lawsuit to force Musk to complete the deal.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">In October 2022, after months of back-and-forth, Musk finally acquired Twitter, completing the $44 billion transaction. Following the acquisition, he could have done better in implementing changes. Top executives, including CEO Parag Agrawal and CFO Ned Segal, were dismissed. Musk also hinted at a new direction for the platform, which he rebranded simply as “X,” aiming to transform it into an “everything app”—a hub for messaging, payments, and much more, inspired by apps like China’s WeChat.</p>
