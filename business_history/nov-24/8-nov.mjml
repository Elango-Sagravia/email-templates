          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">Once an electronics empire, RadioShack was the symbol of American innovation, drawing in tech enthusiasts, hobbyists, and professionals alike, with over 7,000 stores at its peak. Founded in 1921 as a small operation catering to amateur radio operators, RadioShack became a household name in the late 20th century. But as technology shifted, RadioShack failed to adapt, ultimately falling from its position at the top of the retail tech industry and filing for bankruptcy multiple times.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">In the 1970s and '80s, RadioShack surged by tapping into the growing DIY electronics culture. It capitalized on the budding demand for personal computers and components, selling items like CB radios, tape recorders, and later, the Tandy computer—a revolutionary personal computer series that, for a time, even competed with giants like IBM. This product and RadioShack’s tech-oriented inventory drove it to retail dominance. By 1998, RadioShack’s revenue reached $5 billion, making it one of the largest electronic retailers in the world.</p>

          <mj-text padding="10px 12px" font-family="Roboto+Serif" color="#000000">
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">Yet, the seeds of its decline were already sown. RadioShack began an aggressive expansion plan, opening stores across the U.S., often near one another, which led to cannibalization of its sales. As consumer electronics evolved, RadioShack’s core customer base of hobbyists shrank, and the brand struggled to compete with streamlined, high-volume electronics giants like Best Buy and Walmart. When e-commerce began reshaping consumer behavior, RadioShack lagged, unable to adapt to the digital shift with the agility needed to survive.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">During the early 2000s, RadioShack attempted multiple rebranding strategies and leadership changes to stay relevant, including pivoting to cellphone sales. But while RadioShack tried positioning itself as a wireless retailer, it lost focus on its identity, leading to consumer confusion. RadioShack's earnings and market share plummeted with high operational costs, outdated store layouts, and a shrinking customer base. By 2015, the once-iconic brand declared bankruptcy, closing over 1,700 stores. A last-ditch effort to co-brand with Sprint provided temporary relief, but by 2017, the company filed for bankruptcy again.</p>
