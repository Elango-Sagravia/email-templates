        </mj-text>
        <mj-text padding="10px 12px" font-family="Roboto+Serif" color="#000000">
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">Samsung’s rise to dominate South Korea’s economy is both a feat of corporate success and a unique challenge for the country. Founded in 1938 as a small trading company, Samsung rapidly diversified into different industries, mainly focusing on electronics in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Today, Samsung Electronics alone represents nearly 23% of South Korea's GDP, making it one of the most influential single companies in the world. This dominance has transformed Samsung into a pillar of South Korea's economy, impacting nearly every facet of the nation's economic life, from employment to international trade.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">The heart of Samsung's contribution to South Korea’s GDP lies in its semiconductor division, which supplies critical chips to global tech giants, including Apple and Huawei. Samsung is also a leader in smartphones, televisions, and home appliances, making it one of the most diversified electronics companies globally. In 2022, Samsung Electronics reported annual revenues of over $230 billion, driven primarily by its semiconductor sales. This revenue feeds into South Korea’s economy, as Samsung employs nearly 287,000 people worldwide, with many based in South Korea. Additionally, the company works with thousands of suppliers and small businesses nationwide, creating an extensive network that relies heavily on Samsung's success.</p>

          <mj-text padding="10px 12px" font-family="Roboto+Serif" color="#000000">
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">Beyond financials, Samsung’s influence permeates South Korea’s global image as a high-tech innovator. The company’s investments in cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence, 5G, and quantum computing have elevated South Korea’s standing in the global tech landscape. Samsung’s success mirrors Silicon Valley's for the United States, positioning South Korea as a global tech powerhouse with ambitious innovation goals.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">However, this level of influence also comes with vulnerabilities. Samsung’s hold over the South Korean economy can create a fragile economic environment where any disruption in the company’s success can impact the entire nation. This risk became starkly apparent in 2017 when the company’s vice chairman, Lee Jae-Yong, was implicated in a high-profile legal scandal that temporarily shook investor confidence. Furthermore, the company faces cyclical fluctuations in demand for semiconductors and smartphones, which has an outsized effect on South Korea’s GDP. Experts often warn that South Korea’s dependence on Samsung for economic growth is precarious in a volatile global market.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">Recognizing this risk, the South Korean government has sought to encourage economic diversification to reduce reliance on Samsung. However, Samsung plays a central role in shaping the country’s financial future, with ambitious plans for renewable energy, digital health, and robotics.</p>
