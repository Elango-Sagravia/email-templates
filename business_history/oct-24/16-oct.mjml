Amazon's success is not attributed to a single groundbreaking decision; rather, it’s the result of a series of strategic choices and a willingness to keep up and expand. So, we will start this story with a timeline of key events that shaped Amazon as we know it today.</p>

            ">Founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos, Amazon started in a Seattle garage, focusing solely on selling books. At that time, the online bookstore landscape was still emerging, with early players transitioning to the internet. Bezos recognized the potential of the Internet to provide a more extensive selection than any physical store, and he aimed to leverage this opportunity.</p>

            ">The company went public in 1997, marking its first significant milestone on the path to greatness. As the late 1990s rolled in, Bezos had bigger dreams. By 1998, Amazon expanded its inventory to include not just books but also music, electronics, and toys, evolving into a one-stop shop for consumers.

            ">You may wonder how they got to where they are. A game-changing move came in 2000 with the introduction of Amazon Marketplace, allowing third-party sellers to offer their products directly on Amazon’s platform. This increased product variety and positioned Amazon as a dominant player in the industry.</p>

              line-height: 1.4;
            ">But what truly set Amazon apart was the launch of Amazon Prime in 2005. You may know Amazon Prime as a streaming service today, but it actually began as a subscription offering unlimited two-day shipping for an annual fee. </p>

              line-height: 1.4;
            ">In a bold expansion beyond retail, Amazon introduced Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2006, aiming to capitalize on the growing demand for cloud computing. What started as a side project quickly turned into a powerhouse, generating significant revenue and accounting for nearly half of Amazon's operating income by 2020.</p>

              line-height: 1.4;
            ">Strategic acquisitions further fueled Amazon’s growth. The purchase of Zappos in 2009 strengthened its foothold in the online fashion industry, while the $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods in 2017 marked a daring entry into the grocery market.</p>

            ">By the end of 2020, Amazon’s market valuation soared past $1 trillion, solidifying its status as a titan of global retail. Today, while AWS remains a critical revenue stream, Amazon is also exploring emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics, continuously adapting to stay ahead of the competition.</p>
