            ">Lessons from Lehman Brothers</h2>
        </mj-text>
        <mj-text padding="10px 12px" font-family="Roboto+Serif" color="#000000">
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">In September 2008, the world watched in shock as Lehman Brothers, a once-prominent global financial institution, declared bankruptcy. This pivotal moment marked the beginning of a financial crisis that would reverberate globally, exposing vulnerabilities in the economic system. Lehman’s collapse was not an isolated incident but the culmination of reckless investments, inadequate risk management, and an inability to adapt to the rapidly changing market landscape.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">Founded in 1850, Lehman Brothers grew into one of the largest investment banks in the United States. However, in the years leading up to its downfall, the firm became heavily invested in high-risk subprime mortgages, loans granted to borrowers with questionable credit histories. Lehman packaged these loans into mortgage-backed securities, betting on the continuous rise of the housing market. Initially, this strategy paid off; as housing prices soared in the mid-2000s, Lehman leveraged its assets for substantial profits.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">But when the housing bubble burst around 2007, the reality shifted dramatically. Default rates skyrocketed, and the financial instruments that Lehman had invested in lost significant value. Unlike its competitors, Lehman was unable to secure a financial rescue. When it sought help from the Federal Reserve, it was denied, with policymakers fearing that a bailout would set a dangerous precedent. Consequently, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy on September 15, 2008​.</p>

        <mj-text padding="10px 12px" font-family="Roboto+Serif" color="#000000">
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">The aftermath of Lehman’s collapse was immediate and devastating. It triggered a chain reaction across financial markets, instigating panic among investors and leading to a severe liquidity crisis. Credit markets froze, and financial institutions heavily invested in Lehman’s assets were left vulnerable. This event highlighted the fragility of the financial system and underscored the risks of excessive leverage.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">In the wake of the collapse, significant reforms were introduced. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, enacted in 2010, aimed to enhance oversight of financial institutions and prevent future crises. Fundamental changes included stricter capital requirements, greater transparency for financial products, and the establishment of the Volcker Rule, which limited banks' proprietary trading activities.</p>
