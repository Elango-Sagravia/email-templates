          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">Do Won Chang's rise to becoming a billionaire and the founder of Forever 21 is nothing short of extraordinary. His journey from humble beginnings to a leading figure in the fast fashion industry exemplifies resilience, hard work, and seizing opportunities.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">When Chang emigrated from South Korea to the United States in 1981, he faced the harsh realities of starting anew in a foreign land. Arriving in Los Angeles with his wife, they had little money and struggled to make ends meet. Chang took on various low-wage jobs as a janitor, gas station attendant, and coffee shop worker. Each job added to their experience but also fueled his dream of entrepreneurship.</p>

          <mj-text padding="10px 12px" font-family="Roboto+Serif" color="#000000">
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">In 1984, after saving up $11,000, the couple opened their first store, a modest 900-square-foot clothing shop in Highland Park, Los Angeles. Initially named Fashion 21, the store aimed to offer trendy clothing at affordable prices to everyday consumers. Chang and his wife recognized a gap in the market—fashionable clothing often came with hefty price tags, limiting access for many shoppers.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">Its innovative business model set Chang’s venture apart: high inventory turnover and low prices. This fast-fashion approach wasn’t entirely new, but Chang perfected it by sourcing directly from manufacturers, cutting out the middlemen. This strategy allowed Forever 21 to rapidly adapt to changing trends and deliver the latest styles at a fraction of competitors' prices.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">The store quickly gained traction among young shoppers, who appreciated the combination of style and affordability. Within months, Fashion 21's success encouraged the couple to expand, and by 1989, they rebranded as Forever 21. The bright yellow shopping bags became iconic symbols of trendy yet budget-friendly clothing, making the brand a staple in American malls.</p>
         <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">After years of aggressive expansion, Forever 21 faced significant struggles in the late 2010s due to changing consumer preferences, increased competition from e-commerce giants, and oversaturation of physical stores. By 2019, the brand had filed for bankruptcy, struggling to adapt to a market increasingly dominated by online shopping and fast-fashion competitors. But Do Won Chang's legacy as a pioneer in fast fashion continues to influence the industry.</p>
