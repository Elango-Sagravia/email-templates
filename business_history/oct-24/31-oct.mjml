        </mj-text>
        <mj-text padding="10px 12px" font-family="Roboto+Serif" color="#000000">
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">The story of Bumble begins with a bold vision to revolutionize the dating landscape, and at the heart of it is Whitney Wolfe Herd. Her journey into the tech world began with her role as a co-founder of Tinder. After leaving Tinder amidst allegations of sexual harassment, she faced challenges but used her experiences to fuel a new vision. In 2014, she launched Bumble, a dating app designed to empower women by allowing them to make the first move.</p>

          <mj-text padding="10px 12px" font-family="Roboto+Serif" color="#000000">
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">Bumble set itself apart from other dating platforms by giving women control and flipping traditional gender dynamics on their heads. This approach resonated with users, leading to rapid growth. Within a year, Bumble attracted over 15 million users, demonstrating a clear demand for a more female-centric dating experience.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">In 2016, Bumble expanded beyond dating by introducing Bumble BFF, which facilitated platonic friendships, and Bumble Bizz, aimed at professional networking. This diversification transformed Bumble into a platform for meaningful connections across various aspects of life. By 2020, Bumble boasted over 100 million users in 150 countries.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">Wolfe Herd's focus on safety and respect helped cultivate a loyal user base. The app's emphasis on creating a positive environment was particularly appealing in an industry often criticized for its treatment of women. By 2021, Bumble became the second-largest dating app in the U.S., only behind Tinder.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">A significant milestone occurred in February 2021 when Bumble went public, with Wolfe Herd becoming the youngest woman to lead a company to an IPO at the age of 31. The IPO raised $2.2 billion, valuing the company at over $7 billion on its first day of trading. This achievement marked a turning point for women in tech, with Wolfe Herd emerging as one of the youngest self-made female billionaires.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">Today, Bumble continues to grow and innovate while staying true to Wolfe Herd’s original vision of empowerment and connection.</p>
