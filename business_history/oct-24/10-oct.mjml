            ">Elizabeth Holmes founded Theranos in 2003 with a visionary goal: to revolutionize blood testing by enabling comprehensive results from just a single drop of blood. The ambitious concept quickly captured attention, attracting significant investments and partnerships with major healthcare companies. Holmes marketed Theranos as a game-changer in the medical field, promising fast, accurate, and affordable blood tests that could transform patient care.</p>

              line-height: 1.6;
            ">Her charismatic leadership and compelling narrative helped Theranos achieve a valuation of nearly $9 billion at its peak. She surrounded herself with an impressive board of directors, including former secretaries of state and retired military leaders, which added credibility to her venture and fueled public interest and investor enthusiasm. Many believed that Theranos would disrupt traditional blood testing methods and democratize healthcare.</p>

              line-height: 1.6;
            ">However, behind the scenes at Theranos, things were not as they seemed. While Holmes and her team projected an image of groundbreaking innovation, the reality was that the technology did not work as promised. Despite claims of developing a revolutionary device capable of conducting a wide range of tests from a single drop of blood, the company's proprietary machines often delivered inaccurate results and struggled to perform even basic tests reliably​.</p>

              line-height: 1.6;
            ">To mask these issues, Theranos used traditional blood testing methods for many tests while publicly promoting their device as the primary solution. They delivered results to patients and partners without acknowledging that the testing was not performed on their machines.</p>

              line-height: 1.6;
            ">The situation escalated in 2018 when Holmes and former Theranos president Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani faced criminal fraud charges. Prosecutors alleged they had misled investors, doctors, and patients about the capabilities of Theranos's technology. The trial contrasted the company’s lofty promises with the reality of its products. </p>
