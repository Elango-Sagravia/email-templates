            ">We all know Coca-Cola, the drink that has become a cultural icon worldwide. But the story of how it began is fascinating. Founded in 1886 by Atlanta pharmacist Dr. John Stith Pemberton, Coca-Cola was initially created as a medicinal tonic to alleviate headaches and fatigue. The original recipe combined coca leaf extract, which contains trace amounts of cocaine, with kola nut caffeine, giving it a unique flavor and invigorating properties. It was sold for just five cents a glass at local pharmacies and marketed as a remedy for various ailments.</p>
          <p style="
              font-size: 16px;
              line-height: 1.4;
            ">Pemberton's partner, Frank M. Robinson, played a crucial role in branding the beverage. He coined the name "Coca-Cola" and designed its distinctive script logo, which remains iconic to this day. However, Pemberton's health declined, and he sold the rights to the beverage in 1888. Asa Candler, a businessman with a keen marketing sense, purchased the rights and focused on transforming Coca-Cola into a household name.</p>

              font-size: 16px;
              line-height: 1.4;
            ">Candler's strategy was revolutionary. He implemented aggressive marketing campaigns, including distributing free sample coupons, encouraging potential customers to try the drink. By the 1890s, Coca-Cola had gained national prominence, thanks in large part to Candler’s vision of turning it into a refreshing beverage rather than just a medicinal tonic. In 1899, Coca-Cola became the first soft drink to be bottled, making it easier for consumers to enjoy it outside of pharmacies​.</p>

            ">In 1915, Coca-Cola introduced its distinctive contour bottle, a design that helped set it apart from imitators. This unique bottle reinforced brand identity and became an essential part of Coca-Cola's marketing strategy. The early 20th century saw Coca-Cola solidifying its status as America’s favorite soft drink, with clever advertising linking the beverage to happiness and enjoyment.

            ">In the 1980s, Coca-Cola faced stiff competition from Pepsi, which prompted the controversial introduction of “New Coke” in 1985. However, consumer backlash was immediate, leading to a swift return to the original formula under the label “Coca-Cola Classic.” This episode, while initially viewed as a failure, ultimately strengthened the brand's connection to tradition and its loyal customer base. </p>

            ">As the beverage industry evolved, Coca-Cola diversified its offerings. The company expanded into other product lines by acquiring brands like Minute Maid and Dasani, while also responding to changing consumer preferences with the launch of Diet Coke in 1982 and Coca-Cola Zero in 2005, catering to the growing demand for lower-calorie beverages.</p>
