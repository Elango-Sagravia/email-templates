            ">The story of Virgin Group</h2>
        </mj-text>

          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">Richard Branson, the founder of the Virgin Group, is known for his adventurous spirit and bold ventures. However, before achieving billionaire status, he faced significant financial setbacks, declaring bankruptcy twice early in his career.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">Branson's entrepreneurial journey began in the early 1970s with Student, a magazine aimed at young adults. Although the publication had potential, it struggled financially, leaving him in debt. Instead of giving up, Branson pivoted to the music industry, launching a mail-order record company. This venture also faced challenges, but opening the first Virgin Records store in London marked a turning point. The store quickly attracted music lovers, setting the stage for future success.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">Branson's big break came in 1973 when Virgin Records signed Mike Oldfield, whose album Tubular Bells became a hit. This success allowed Virgin to expand, signing influential acts like the Sex Pistols establishing a reputation as a disruptor in the music scene. However, Branson's financial woes were not over. In the early 1980s, he launched Virgin Atlantic, a risky move for someone with a history of bankruptcy. The airline initially struggled to compete with larger carriers, and at one point, Branson was on the verge of losing it all. He mortgaged his home to keep the airline afloat, and his gamble paid off as Virgin Atlantic gained a reputation for excellent service.</p>

          <mj-text padding="10px 12px" font-family="Roboto+Serif" color="#000000">
          <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4">By the late 1980s, Branson had transformed Virgin into a global brand with over 400 companies across various sectors, including music, airlines, and telecommunications. Despite early setbacks, his willingness to take risks and adapt allowed him to build an empire valued at over $5 billion today. </p>
