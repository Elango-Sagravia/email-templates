            Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad has <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2024/12/07/syrian-president-bashar-al-assad-leaves-damascus-rebels-advance/76846432007/" target="_blank">fled</a> the country. Opposition groups have taken more towns, celebrating the end of his family’s rule. Freed prisoners have reunited with their families, fostering hopes for democracy after nearly 14 years of <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2024/12/08/after-14-years-of-conflict-assads-fall-brings-an-end-to-syrias-dynastic-rule" target="_blank">conflict</a>.

Meanwhile, Russia maintains heightened security at its bases in Syria, and Syrian rebel leaders have assured the safety of these sites. A transitional government led by Mohammed al-Bashir, linked to the northwestern rebel administration, has been <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/does-syrias-power-shift-raise-hopes-for-stability-and-democracy/a-71006195" target="_blank">established</a> to govern until March 2025, focusing on unity and stability.

            <strong>🇦🇺 Australia-Naru deal:</strong> 
            Australia and Nauru have signed a significant security <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/australia-nauru-ink-landmark-security-deal/a-70998063" target="_blank">treaty</a> to counter China's influence in the Pacific. The treaty mandates that Nauru consult Australia before entering agreements on security and critical infrastructure, giving Australia oversight of Nauru’s ports and banking. In return, Australia will provide nearly $64 million in aid over five years. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese highlighted the treaty's role in maintaining regional stability amidst China's growing <a href="https://theconversation.com/chinas-increasing-political-influence-in-the-south-pacific-has-sparked-an-international-response-222105" target="_blank">ties</a> with Pacific nations. The South Pacific remains a key <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/06/06/asia/china-pacific-islands-wang-yi-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank">competition</a> between China and Western nations, particularly Australia and the US.

            <strong>🇰🇷 South Korean Foreign Minister jailed:</strong> 
            South Korean police <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/south-korea-arrests-ex-defense-minister-over-martial-law/a-70993411" target="_blank">arrested</a> former defense minister Kim Yong-hyun on Sunday for his role in President Yoon Suk Yeol’s martial law attempt. Kim Yong-Hyun, considered central to the decree, faces insurrection charges alongside Yoon and martial law commander Park An-su. Kim Yong-Hyun went on to attempt suicide while in custody but survived. The <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/10/asia/south-korea-defense-minister-suicide-attempt-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank">incident</a> occurred in the bathroom, and Kim Yong-Hyun gave up on the attempt when the corrections officer came in. The officers have moved him to isolation and confirmed that he has no health issues.

            <strong>🇨🇳 China-Taiwan war games:</strong> 
           Tensions between China and Taiwan have <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/taiwan-says-china-deploying-largest-naval-fleet-in-decades/a-71008022" target="_blank">escalated</a>, with Taiwan’s Defense Ministry reporting the largest Chinese naval deployment near the island in nearly three decades. 47 Chinese military aircraft and 12 warships were detected, surpassing the military presence during the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3187774/beijings-war-games-taiwan-after-pelosis-trip-spark-concerns" target="_blank">2022</a> war games triggered by Nancy Pelosi’s visit. Taiwan is on high alert, as Chinese forces are forming “two walls” in the Pacific, suggesting an attempt to claim the Taiwan Strait as internal waters. Relations soured after Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te <a href="https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-us-china-lai-ching-te-hawaii-guam-7abcd0e5803fdb7f20615fd394aca91b" target="_blank">visited</a> the U.S., which Beijing condemned. Taiwan maintains its sovereignty and relies on U.S. support for defense, while China views Taiwan as part of its territory. Since Lai took office, China has conducted two large-scale military drills around Taiwan.

            <strong>🇮🇷 Iran points fingers:</strong> 
           Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2024/12/11/iran-blames-us-and-israel-for-bashar-al-assads-fall-from-power-in-syria" target="_blank">accuses</a> the United States and Israel of causing the collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s government in Syria, claiming he has “evidence” to support this. He suggested a neighboring country played a significant role, likely pointing to <a href="https://www.cfr.org/expert-brief/what-role-turkey-playing-syrias-civil-war" target="_blank">Turkey</a> due to its involvement in Syria. The US, Israel, and Turkey have supported various Syrian proxies and conducted <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/09/israel-us-and-turkey-launch-strikes-to-protect-interests-in-syria" target="_blank">strikes</a>. Additionally, Assad's decline may result from his main allies, Russia and Iran, being distracted by their conflicts, with Russia's support strained by the war in Ukraine and Iran focused on arming proxies against Israel.
