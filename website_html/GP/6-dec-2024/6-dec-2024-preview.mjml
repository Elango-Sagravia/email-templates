          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">The Israeli military recently <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/04/middleeast/israel-hostages-airstrike-hamas-intl-latam/index.html" target="_blank">announced</a> that a February 14 airstrike in <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/wtsS1LrUYGJSZwzZ6" target="_blank">Khan Younis</a>, southern Gaza, may have indirectly contributed to the deaths of six Israeli captives whose remains were found in August. An investigation revealed that they likely survived the initial strike but were subsequently killed by militants, who themselves perished from the secondary effects of the attack. IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said they were not able to determine the cause of death due to the amount of time passed between the shooting and the forensic examination.</p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;">The broader conflict, now over 14 months long, has <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/06/middleeast/palestinians-displaced-gaza-israel-intl/index.html" target="_Blank">displaced</a> most of Gaza’s population, many of whom face famine-like conditions, especially in the north. International aid deliveries have been severely <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/1/unrwa-pauses-aid-through-key-gaza-crossing-as-hunger-stalks-palestinians#:~:text=The%20UN%20agency%20for%20Palestinian%20refugees%20has%20halted,as%20widespread%20hunger%20and%20deadly%20Israeli%20bombardments%20continue." target="_Blank">restricted</a>, compounding the suffering of civilians. Amidst the chaos, the Israeli army has released an official <a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israeli-army-admits-targeting-humanitarian-area-in-gaza-s-khan-younis/3414654#:~:text=The%20Israeli%20army%20on%20Thursday%20admitted%20that%20it,airstrike%20killed%2023%20Palestinians%20and%20injured%20dozens%20more." target="_Blank">statement</a> that it has carried out a “precise air attack” against a Hamas operative, which saw the death of 23 Palestinians, including women and children.

          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4; filter: blur(5px);">Romania’s recent parliamentary elections saw the leftist Social Democrats (PSD) win 21% of the vote, with far-right AUR gaining 18%, revealing the rising <a href="https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/12/03/romanias-elections-show-pro-eu-victory-and-rise-of-the-far-right" target="_Blank">polarization</a>. Pro-European centrists, supported by a Hungarian minority party, are expected to form a majority coalition. Meanwhile, the upcoming presidential runoff on Saturday between pro-EU Elena Lasconi and nationalist Calin Georgescu will be pivotal.</p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4; filter: blur(5px);">Social media amplifies the increasing anti-EU and pro-Kremlin narratives, fueling populist sentiment. Calin Geogescu rose to fame on <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/tiktok-calin-georgescu-presidential-candidate-romania/33216735.html" target="_Blank">TikTok</a> and gained support from young voters who initially were seen as more progressive than the previous generations. However, the far-right movements in Europe have seen many supporters from younger generations for various <a href="https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/06/21/why-is-the-far-right-gaining-popularity-among-young-people" target="_Blank">reasons</a>, including getting rid of technocrats, returning to a “Europe of nations,” and weakening “ineffective and corrupt” traditional parties. Some are dissatisfied with the status quo and feel reactionary messages offer simple solutions to changing it. Romania joins the European trend, where many countries struggle between pro-EU forces and nationalist movements.​</p>
