          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">More than 1,000 people, including 745 civilians, were killed in two days of clashes between Syrian security forces and fighters loyal to the ousted Assad regime. The violence erupted after <a style="text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 2px solid  #06266D; color: black;" href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-10-03-2025-h1-1-assad-loyalists-ambushed-security-forces?source=website" target="_blank">Assad loyalists ambushed security forces</a> in Jableh, Latakia. This led to a brutal crackdown. Reports show mass executions, revenge killings, and widespread fear. It is severe among the Alawite minority, which Al Assad comes from.</p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">Syria’s transitional president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, wrote the violence off as an “expected challenge.” He urged everyone to seek national unity. Human rights groups warn that the killings could deepen sectarian divides. Residents report power and water outages, with corpses left in the streets. Videos allegedly show executions and abuse, though they remain unverified.
       </p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">The UN and France have condemned the violence, urging independent investigations. Syria’s transitional government is set to be announced soon. Pressure is mounting for an inclusive administration to prevent further bloodshed. Rights groups are stressing that representation of Syria’s diverse communities is a must to break the cycle of violence.

The Liberal Party voted an overwhelming 85.9% for Carney to see him take the mantle. However, he may not be in this position for long as Canada should conduct an election by October. Carney may call for a snap election within weeks.</p>

          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">Carney made his fortunes as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs. In 2020, he left the Bank of England to serve as a United Nations envoy.  He helped the private sector to invest in climate-friendly technology. He has never served in parliament nor held an elected public office. Trudeau and Carney will visit Canada's Governor General Mary Simon, who will task the leader with forming a government.</p>

          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">A few months ago, it was almost certain that the Conservative Party would win the upcoming general election. However, the Liberal Party has narrowed the Conservatives’ double-digit lead. This is a result of President Trump’s threats against Canada. The Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre, have remained strong by focusing on housing, crime, and the healthcare system.</p>

          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">On International Women's Day, the Taliban asserted its commitment to <a style="text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 2px solid  #06266D; color: black;" href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-10-03-2025-h3-3-safeguarding-afghan-womens-rights?source=website" target="_blank">safeguarding Afghan women's rights</a>. They said that the rights are within the framework of Islamic law and Afghan culture. Taliban spokesperson Zbihullah Mujahid stressed that Afghan women "live in security, both physically and psychologically. "He also added that their fundamental rights are protected. </p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">The Taliban has imposed severe restrictions on women's rights since taking over in 2021. These include bans on education beyond the sixth grade and limitations on employment. There is also a limitation to public presence. The United Nations and the international community have condemned these actions and renewed calls for bans to be lifted. </p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">Taliban leaders have also accused the EU and other bodies of hypocrisy for holding conferences to discuss women’s rights in Afghanistan. Their interpretation of women's rights is distinct from not only Western norms but also other Islamic norms. Many other Islamic countries have women in higher education. Women are involved in their respective countries' governments. </p>

          </p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">China has escalated its warnings against Taiwan. China's military spokesman stated that if separatism intensifies, <a style="text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 2px solid  #06266D; color: black;" href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-10-03-2025-br1-4-beijing-will-tighten-its-noose?source=website" target="_blank">Beijing will "tighten its noose"</a> around the island. The statement also warned that Taiwan independence advocates would face a "dead end" and urged them to step back from the "precipice." Beijing has long viewed Taiwan as part of its territory and has not ruled out using force to achieve reunification.</p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te has reassured that he does not seek formal independence. His past remarks have still led China to label him a separatist. The warning comes amid China's "Two Sessions" political gathering, where Beijing announced a 7.2% increase in its 2025 defense budget. Despite economic barriers, China is pushing its commitment to military modernization.</p>

          </p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">South Korea's suspended President, Yoon Suk Yeol, was <a style="text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 2px solid  #06266D; color: black;" href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-10-03-2025-br2-5-released-from-detention?source=website" target="_blank">released from detention</a> after a court annulled his arrest on technical grounds. Yoon was detained for nearly two months after declaring martial law in December 2024. He still faces insurrection charges and a Constitutional Court ruling on his impeachment. His release had mass protests, with over 55,000 supporters rallying in Seoul and 32,500 counter-protesters opposing him.</p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">Yoon’s martial law order, which suspended political and press freedoms, led to his impeachment on December 14, 2024. If convicted, he could face life imprisonment or the death penalty. However, the death penalty in South Korea hasn't been used since 1997. The upcoming court decision on his impeachment will determine his official removal from office.</p>

          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">A coalition government is formed when multiple political parties join to work as one governing body. This usually happens when no single party wins enough seats or votes in an election to form a majority. Instead of one party running the government, two or more parties negotiate and form a coalition to create a majority. In a coalition government, the parties involved usually agree on a shared policy agenda. 
</p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">
          Coalition governments are typical in parliamentary systems, like in many European countries with more than two parties. An example of this can be seen in Germany. <a style="text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 2px solid  #06266D; color: black;" href="https://link.geopoliticalsummary.com/gs-10-03-2025-f1-6-friedrich-merz-center-right-party-is-forming-a-coalition?source=website" target="_blank">Friedrich Merz's Center-Right party is forming a coalition</a> with Olaf Scholz's Center-Left party. Austria also recently formed an alliance of three center parties to offset the far-right party that received the most votes.</p>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5;">The benefit of a coalition is that the government can be more inclusive and represent a broader range of views. It can also offset a political party with extremist (left or right) rhetoric. However, it can also be less stable. Disagreements between coalition partners can and do often happen. These can cause tensions or even lead to the collapse of the government.</p>
