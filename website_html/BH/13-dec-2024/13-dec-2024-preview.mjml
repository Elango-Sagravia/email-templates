          In the 1930s, a soap manufacturer named Cleo McVicker stumbled upon the invention of a product that would eventually become <strong>Play-Doh</strong>. Initially, the substance, a simple blend of water, salt, and flour, wasn’t meant for kids' creative play. <strong>Its first purpose was to clean coal soot from wallpaper</strong>, a necessary tool in homes heated by coal furnaces, which were still widespread at the time. This product, sold under the name Kutol Wallpaper Cleaner, was practical, and it found a niche in the market for its effectiveness in scrubbing away grime.</p>

          By the 1950s, coal heating systems were becoming outdated, and as society shifted toward cleaner heating methods, the demand for wallpaper cleaners decreased. Cleo McVicker's company faced financial difficulties and needed to find a new direction. They observed that <strong>children struggled with modeling clay</strong>, as its texture was stiff and hard to manipulate. This observation sparked an idea: <strong>why not use the malleable wallpaper cleaner as a soft and easy-to-use alternative?</strong></p>

           In 1956, the wallpaper cleaner was <strong>rebranded as “Play-Doh.”</strong> The new product, now marketed as a toy, began to gain traction with children and parents alike. McVicker partnered with Macy’s department store, and the product was featured in prominent television programs like Captain Kangaroo. These strategic moves helped Play-Doh find its way into homes across America.</p>

          By the late 1950s, Play-Doh had already sold over 2 million cans, and the once-forgotten wallpaper cleaner had become a household name. In 1991, <strong>Hasbro acquired Play-Doh</strong>, ensuring its evolution into new forms, including themed playsets and creative kits.</p>
           <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4; filter: blur(5px);">
           Today, Play-Doh has sold more than <strong>3 billion cans worldwide</strong>.</p>
